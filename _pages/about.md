#  About me

My name is Tao Wang, and I am from Anhui. Under the guidance of [Assoc. Prof. Jianmin, Zeng](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/info/1035/1478.htm), I earned my Master's degree in [Psychology from Southwest University](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/#) ([Top-5 psychological department in China](https://research.com/university-rankings/psychology/cn)). Throughout my graduate studies, Professor Zeng's guidance was instrumental. I 
had the opportunity to collaborate with esteemed researchers such as [Weijie Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weijie-Huang-9) and [Li Su](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Su-10), leading 
to our publication, "Right thalamic volume mediates impact of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene on the endowment effect" in the well-regarded journal, *Behavioural Brain Research* [JCR: **Q2**; CiteScore: **Q2**]. Additionally, I developed proficiency in advanced research techniques including meta-analysis, which enabled me to publish a paper titled "Social decision-making in major depressive disorder: A three-level meta-analysis", in the *Journal of Psychiatric Research* [JCR: **Q1**; CiteScore: **Q1**]."

**My research interest includes:**
- Decision-making
- Behavioural economics
- Neuroeconomics
- Mental disorders
- Meta-analysis

- **Brief Introduction:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is frequently associated with social dysfunction and impaired decision-making, but its impact on social decisions remains unclear. Our meta-analytic study reveals that MDD significantly impacts social decision-making, manifesting as reduced trust and increased cooperation, with these effects moderated by demographic and treatment variables. These findings emphasize the necessity for tailored therapeutic approaches that consider individual differences in age, education, and treatment coverage, to enhance social functionality and outcomes for MDD patients.
