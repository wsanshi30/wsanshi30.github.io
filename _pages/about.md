#  About me

My name is Tao Wang, and I am from Anhui. Under the guidance of [Assoc. Prof. Jianmin, Zeng](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/info/1035/1478.htm), I earned my Master's degree in [Psychology from Southwest University](http://psy.swu.edu.cn/#) ([Top-5 psychological department in China](https://research.com/university-rankings/psychology/cn)). During my graduate studies, with the support of Professor Zeng, I collaborated with researchers such as [Weijie Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Weijie-Huang-9) and [Li Su](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Su-10), culminating in the publication of our article titled ‚Äú[Right thalamic volume mediates impact of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene on the endowment effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432824002067?via%3Dihub)‚Äù in *Behavioural Brain Research* [***JCR: Q2; CiteScore: Q2***]. Additionally, I acquired expertise in advanced techniques like meta-analysis, which I applied to successfully complete two research papers published in the *Journal of Psychiatric Research* [***JCR: Q1; CiteScore: Q1***] and the *Journal of Affective Disorders Reports* [CiteScore: Q2], respectively.

**My research interest includes:**
- Decision-making
- Behavioural economics
- Neuroeconomics
- Mental disorders
- Meta-analysis

- **Main finding:** MDD patients exhibited a significant reduction in trust, no significant difference in altruistic punishment, and an increase in cooperative behaviors compared to HCs. The moderation analysis revealed that age and region significantly moderated altruistic punishment. Additionally, age, years of education, and treatment coverage significantly moderated cooperation.
